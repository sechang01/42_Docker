#03 - Define the variables needed by your virtual machine Char in the general env of your
# terminal, so that you can run the docker ps command without errors. You have
# to fix all four environment variables with one command, and you are not allowed
# to use your shellâ€™s builtin to set these variables by hand.

eval $(docker-machine env Char)

#docker ps lists all the "process statuses" including all the running containers
#docker ps -a sees all the containers running in the background
