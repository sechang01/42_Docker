#6 - Launch an nginx container, available on Docker Hub, as a background task. It
# should be named overlord, be able to restart on its own, and have its 80 port
# attached to the 5000 port of Char. You can check that your container functions
# properly by visiting
# http://<ip-de-char>:5000 on your web browser.

docker pull nginx
docker run -d -p 5000:80 --name overlord nginx

#https://docs.docker.com/samples/library/nginx/
#enginex, apache uses port 80 by default mysql uses 3306. 5000 is the port you want to use locally.
# d is detached - run in background 
# p is publish - port
# name is adding a name - overlord
# --env VARIABLE=value - setting an environment variable
# docker container exect -it overlord bash - goes into container
# exit to leave
# cd usr/share/nginx/html/index.html is what the default page runs
